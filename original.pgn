1. e4 { Before we start I am stating for the record that I have a long history playing and studying the french opening, and I am extremely biased and opiniated. Don't let whatever is written here stop you from playing, trying and exploring things you find fun. If it isn't fun it isn't worth playing.
The engine has for the most part been turned off and will remain off during the course of this analysis. SF is a silly beasts and shouldn't be trusted. Obviously that isn't true but engines evaluate and play chess vastly different from humans and it can often be more instructive and fun to ignore them. I will consult it quickly at times to ensure I don't say anything too dumb. However, feel free to double check the analysis with our fishy friend and make your own opinions. Complaints can be directed towards the country of France.
This game illustrates the dangers black can face in one of the sharpest lines in the French opening. Tarrasch with 5.f4. In addition it confirms the natural phenoma of the Strawberry beating the doctor into the ground and making sure the medical professional stays far away. } { [%clk 0:10:00] } 1... e6 { This is typically going to bring us into a French structure. Probably one of the most played openings and structures in chess history, and one of my personal favorites. It's typically one of the first openings I recommend to new players looking to get into opening theory. Even though it is extremely complex, the basic plans are easy to understand and learn. In my view it's also an ideal opening for self study.
We can already predict that the black bishop on c8 is going to be left inside the pawn chain, and is probably not going to be the happiest carrot in the box. Typically one of black's main goals are to exchange this as soon as possible.
Many uneducated think of the French as a passive and even boring opening. But let me assure you that is not the case. If both players want to play a boring game you are probably getting bored to death no matter which opening you chose. The opposite is also true. The French typically has a closed centre where white has an easier time developing and more activity. This is in itself a good indication that it might be possible to launch an attack. So if you find yourself stuck playing boring games ask yourself: is it the opening that is wrong, or is your opponent? Obviously, it can't be you. You are perfect the way you are. } { [%clk 0:10:00] } 2. d4 { [%clk 0:09:52] } 2... d5 { In my mind this is the starting point of the French defence. No idea if that is actually the case. But now it's finally too late to deviate into other openings. Like all chess openings the french is incredibly rich and has a lot of options for both players. If you are like me and like reading chess books the book "Play The French" by John Watson has been considered the holy grail and bible for french players since the dawn of time. It's good. Go buy it and encourage him to make another updated version. If not for yourself, then do it for me. Pretty please.
Some very superficial things worth points out about the pawn structure.
1. The Black lightsquared bishop is stuck inside the pawn structure is generally a problem. Black wants to get rid of this asap. White doesn't want black to be able to get rid of it. This is a very common concept you will see in many lines. Some players that value that bishop more than me opt for the (inferior) caro-kann instead which often shares some structural similarities.
2. } { [%clk 0:10:00] } 3. Nd2 { This is known as the French Tarrasch. Named after Siegbert Tarrasch who was considered one of the best chess players of his time, late 1800s early 1900s. He remains a chess legend to this day and his games are worth checking out.
Chess openings are like most things in life, susceptible to trends and fashion. After Karpov started playing it with great results, it became one of the main lines against the French and it remains one of the biggest pains in black French players' rear to this day.
The move itself makes a lot of sense. White develops a piece while keeping an eye on the central e4-pawn. One advantage with 3.Nd2 over the slightly more common 3.Nc3 is that you sidestep the extremely sharp Winawer line where black answers 3.Nc3 with 3...Bb4. Here white would simply be able to respond with c3 and give the black player a look of disgust. This has made it a favorite for players too smart, scared or lazy to try to memorize the crazy lines in the Winawer. It's hard to criticize this as the Tarrasch is extremely flexible and allows white to aim the game towards whatever type of position the player is most comfortable playing. Whether that's super sharp and sketchy attacking chess, or a slower and more positional approach.
I'll quickly and very superficially go through some random lines in the move alternatives. } { [%clk 0:09:51] } (3. e5 { The Advance variation. This is typically onne of the first structures you learn when playing around with the French. The pawn structure we see here is basically what makes the French the French. } 3... c5 4. c3 Qb6 (4... Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 6. Bd3 cxd4 7. cxd4 Nxd4 8. Nxd4 Qxd4 9. Bb5+ { Yep. Sometimes we can't take hanging pawns. }) 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. a3 c4 7. Nbd2 Nge7 8. Bxc4 { Trick!! Back in the day I learned this the hard way multiple times. } 8... dxc4 9. Nxc4 Qa6 10. Nd6+ { Is just gg. }) (3. Nc3 Bb4 { French: Winawer (FUN!) } (3... Nf6 { French: Classical. Fun can be had here. But if you are used to the thrills of the Winawer you might want to adjust your expectations. }) (3... dxe4 { French: Rubinstein (BORING) }) 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Ba5 { I still consider this bad. To my knowledge this was considered bad for black for a long time until it got revived by more modern engines. But I can't with good conscience recommend this for black. I just find it incredibly hard to play for black. White will be having the best time of his life with an active position that is easier to play. No thanks. } (5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 { This position is probably the french position I and many others have spend the majority of their time on. Here alone white has four main different plans. You could probably easily square that number if you include smaller nuances. If it was up to me I would classify the two main-main lines as 6...Ne7/Qc7 7.Qg4 0-0 or 7...Qc7. } 6... Ne7 7. a4 (7. h4) (7. Qg4 Qc7 { This is the poisoned pawn variaton. TLDR: Very fun, very dangerous. } (7... O-O { If you are a thrill seeker but want to avoid the near death experiences that will be brought by 7...Qc7 this line might be for you. Typically black will play f5 followed by e5 in some fashion. While white finishes development while maintaining some kind of king side attack. } 8. Bd3 f5 9. exf6 Rxf6 10. Bg5 Rf7 { [%cal Ge6e5] } 11. Qh5 g6) (7... Kf8 { Some weirdos even play this })) (7. Nf3 b6 { Threatening Ba6 swapping the bad bishop for white's good bishop. } (7... Nbc6 8. Bd3 O-O { This is another very common trick that you will see in these structures. With pawns on d4-e5 and e6-d5 the following sacrifice almost always work. So keep an eye for this when you get this type of structure. It can often be an idea in other similiarish structures as well. } 9. Bxh7+ Kxh7 10. Ng5+ Kg8 (10... Kg6 11. h4 { Pain is coming } (11. Qd3+ Nf5 12. h4 { Pain is coming })) 11.

Bd7 9. Bd3 { This illustrates what we talked about earlier with the bishop dance. Black wants to exchange. White wants to avoid it at all costs. } 9... Ba4 10. O-O c4 11. Be2 h6 12. Ne1 Kd7!! { is probably my favorite chess opening move ever. And the whole reason I included other french lines than the one played in the game. I want to show you all this move, if you haven't already seen it. The plan is simple. Black is going to go Qg8->h7 and put pressure on the c2-pawn, which white will have to invest a lot of pieces into defending it. For your own sake look into this fun line. })) 6. b4! cxd4 (6... cxb4 7. Nb5 bxa3+ 8. c3 { [%cal Gc1a3,Ga3f8] }) 7. Nb5 Bc7 8. f4 Bd7 9. Nf3 { the rest is left as an exercise to the reader. } (9. Nxc7+)) 3... Nf6 { This is and has been one of the main moves for decades. It pains me to say that from a boring objective point of view 3...c5 is probably easier to play. But I would recommend to ignore that and play 3...Nf6 like our french player here. It's much more fun and makes more sense. } { [%clk 0:09:58] } (3... c5 { Boooring. But this move seems to have been the go-to at the highest level the recent years. } 4. exd5 Qxd5 5. Ngf3 cxd4 6. Bc4 { Black players indecision on where to move the queen is probably the most interesting part of this entire line from blacks point of view. As is often the case in chess the different following queen placements all have different nuances. I'll leave the explaining of that to players much wiser than me. } 6... Qd6 { Is the most popular } (6... Qd7) (6... Qd8)) 4. e5 { [%clk 0:09:32] } 4... Nfd7 { [%clk 0:09:57] } 5. f4 { This is possibly the sharpest (and most fun) line in the French Tarrasch. If you want to crush your French friends quickly, and get home before rush traffic, this might be the most effective line. White dreams of eventually playing f5, forcing open black's entire structure and pawn chain in front of his king. Pain is likely to follow. } { [%clk 0:09:32] } (5. Bd3 { Has been the most played line for ages in the Tarrasch } 5... c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ne2 cxd4 8. cxd4 f6 9. exf6 Nxf6 10. Nf3 Bd6 11. O-O O-O (11... Qc7 { Has gotten more popular than 11...0-0 due to the fact that black keeps the good bishop and avoids a lot of forced weird things, like in the other mentioned lines. }) 12. Bf4 Bxf4 13. Nxf4 Ne4 14. Ne2 Rxf3 15. gxf3 Ng5 16. Kh1 e5 17. dxe5 Nxf3 18. Bxh7+ Kh8 19. Ng1 Ncd4 20. Nxf3 Bg4 21. Nxd4 Bxd1 22. Raxd1 Kxh7 23. f4 { Is a cool line that's worth having seen. I played this a couple of times myself as black when I was young and dumb. At that time it was supposedly considered close to a draw, but as we can see there is still a lot of play left. I would think it's easier to play white here, but I don't really know. This is way above my paygrade. }) 5... c5 { Dr. Mike shows that he is familiar with the French philosophy. Black starts attacking the centre. c5 is the most natural and normal way to do that. Often you will also see some sort of an f6 break as well. But f6 typically immediately and irrevocably destroys your own kingside and king safety. So don't attempt that at home unless you have a position that calls for it. } { [%clk 0:09:55] } 6. c3 { [%clk 0:09:30] } 6... Nc6 { [%clk 0:09:54] } 7. Ndf3 { When we start out learning chess one of the first things we learn is that we shouldn't move the same piece twice, before all our other friends have been developed. This horsey either didn't get that memo, or doesn't care. Luckily chess is filled with exceptions and this is one of them. The b1 knight doesn't really have a future on the queenside and is well placed on f3, where it covers all the central white pawns. Soon it will be assited by its friend that will leap to e2 and strengten the d4-pawn further. Later, as we will see in this game (SPOILER), the knight will launch a devestating attack via the g5 square. } { [%clk 0:09:29] } 7... a5?! { This move has been played 25 times in the Lichess master db and 3476 in the Lichess online database. I don't believe for a second that this is a move the position calls for. It's a bit slow and might leave some long-lasting weaknesses, such as the b5 square. It probably doesn't matter much in this type of position but it's worth keeping in mind that pawns refuse to go backwards, and that every pawn move leaves weaknesses. It probably isn't objectively bad from an engine evaluation point of view. But I am still going to claim it's an unatural move that black shouldn't spend time on. Even though black is still solid and the position seems somewhat balanced, white is only a few moves away from playing f5 and starting the party.
On the positive side a5 does grab some space on the queenside. } { [%clk 0:09:53] } (7... Qb6 8. g3 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bb4+ 10. Kf2 { Has been considered the main line in the 5.f4 tarrasch for a while. The white king is somewhat safe as the centre is closed for the moment. But black doesn't intend to keep it that way. } 10... g5 { Has been the critical test for some time. Crazy fun stuff follows. Generally the engine seems to enjoy playing white but in a practical game noone knows what's going on. This is one of the lines that is a lot of fun analyzing. But most would be too scared to play with any colour in a serious game. Don't let yourself be one of them! Find some lines you find interesting and play them. The best way to learn is to do, try and fail. Your opponent is going to be just as scared as you. } 11. fxg5 Ndxe5) (7... cxd4 8. cxd4 Qb6) 8. a3? { This in my eyes just justifies black's 7...a5. The b3-square is now possibly permanently weak and as a result white's entire queenside structure is less flexible and will probably be held down for the rest of the game. Obviously this won't matter if white gets f5 in and just delivers mate. But now white risks being structurally worse if the attack should fail. When our opponent starts doing things we think are meaningless we should just let them do that while we do our own thing. } { [%csl Gb3] [%clk 0:09:26] } (8. Bd3 { Probably white should just continue like normal. Put all the pieces in their ideal position. Then we can start dreaming about the f5 break and the imminent following beautiful mate. } 8... a4 9. Ne2 a3 10. b3 { [%cal Gf4f5] } 10... cxd4 11. cxd4 Bb4+ 12. Kf2 { This just looks like a dream for white. In this line white has no problem putting the king on f2. The centre is closed so we have all the time in the world to play g3, Kg2, Rf1 or whatever we want to. }) 8... a4 { Shuts down white's queenside pawns and locks down the b3 square, and possibly also the c4 square that could be ideal squares for white's knights. } { [%clk 0:09:46] } (8... Qb6) 9. g3 { Very common move in this line. Personally I would probably skip it for now and just play Bd3. With the pawns on a3 and a4 it's clear to me that white's white squared bishop belongs on d3, where it can assist keeping an eye on the weakened b3 and c4 squares. But g3 can't be wrong. It opens a potential square on g2 for your king and it supports the pawn chain. It also allows you some flexibility when it comes to where you want your light squared bishop. In some cases it might be better positioned on h3 where in addition to supporting the f5 break it also attacks the black e6 pawn. } { [%clk 0:09:21] } (9. Bd3) 9... cxd4 { In general I recommend to try to keep the tension in the centre as long as possible. So unless cxd4 is necessary or white is threatening to avoid it I would prefer waiting with cxd4. } { [%clk 0:09:44] } (9... Qb6 10. Ne2 Na5 { Seems like a way to try to pretend our a5 idea has any merit. But it doesn't really seem to achieve much. } 11. Qxa4 { I did turn on the engine for this one. SF believes you can just take this pawn. So that is probably factually correct, but it does scare me a bit. But if blacks best move is 11...Qb3 this doesn't make much sense. } (11. Bh3 { would be another sensible way to play. White continues developing the last pieces and prepares to play f5. })) (9... Nb6 { would be similar to the game. Hard to say whether keeping the tension in the centre changes much. It probably doesn't. } { [%cal Gc6a5,Gb6c4,Ga5b3] }) 10. cxd4 { [%clk 0:09:20] } 10... Nb6 { [%clk 0:09:39] } 11. Bd3 { [%clk 0:09:16] } 11... Na5 { The knights are eyeing the squares that have opened up as a result of the a-pawn push. } { [%clk 0:09:32] } 12. Ng5 { A wise plumber once said "Here we go!", and it does indeed seem like white is going somewhere. It's currently unclear if it's someplace good. My first impression is that Ng5 is too early and as a result weird. It doesn't really threaten that much and we should probably finish development and maybe even get f5 in before we start the party. I am unsure what would be my go to move. Probably something like Bc2 or Rb1 followed by Ne2 or Nh3 and then we start dreaming about f5.
A general rule of thumb is that before you launch an attack you want to finish development and bring your own king to safety. This is particularly true when you have a nice space advantage with easier development. White often has this in the openings due to having the first move. In my mind this is in general what gives white an opening advantage. If the goal is to win games it is probably smart to follow that guideline. But as a rebel I do greatly enjoy watching players and games that deviate from main principles in order to launch an attack. If you are looking for more games in this fashion the go-to player is probably Mikhail Tal. He has some amazing sketchy games that will make even the worst engine throw a fit.
While we are discussing this topic let me let you in on another secret no chess player wants you to know. So make sure you don't tell anyone. If your goal is to perform consistently at a higher level, and maybe go for some norms, new rating high scores, or impress your local Norwegian IM, probably the best "playing style" is to bore your opponent to death. With this I mean we do all the basic stuff well. We fight for the centre. We develop our pieces, typically towards the centre. We get our King somewhere safe. Then we just chill, gradually improving our position and putting pressure on weakpoints, and try to make some new ones. We are not in a hurry. We are just here to inflict the maximum amount of suffering to our opponent and any poor souls that have made the mistake of watching the game. If our good friend the horsey wants to go to a nice outpost we try to assist it.
Our main goal is to stop our opponent's plans before they happen, create weaknesses and put pressure on these weaknesses. If you want to appear like you know your stuff you can call it "Prophylaxis" to your friends. It's chess for "I am not going to allow you any fun". Really it's greek for "guard" and usually used in chess as a catch all for preventative moves. Moves that avoid your opponent's plans before they materialize. But, my definition captures the essence better. To my knowledge this way of thinking was first popularized by Aaron Nimzowitsch in possibly one of the most famous chess books of all time: "My system". For the record, I don't think it's a very good book. But, it has obvious historical value.
Probably the most notable players that I would claim approached chess in a similar way are two of the greats: Tigran Petrosian and Anatoly Karpov. The problem with pointing at heroes at the highest level is that both them and their opponents are so good at chess that it's hard to call them anything besides complete chess players. Obviously, it's hard to not mention Magnus Carlsen. One of the things he will likely be remembered for is his ability of grinding out objectively equal positions by not really doing too much. Chances are if the player has been top 10 in the world they have games that illustrate this concept. If you for some insane reason decide to look at my games please note that I used to be a caveman with no regard for the life of chess pieces. So if you want games that explore this concept you are probably best off ignoring all my games, except some of the most recent ones. But don't look at my games. I know nothing. Look at the players that actually know how the game works.
To read more about this see notes after 12...h6.
TLDR: Ng5 bad, but fun. So the move won't be awarded any negative symbols. } { [%clk 0:09:00] } (12. Bc2 { Probably just simpler, and very much in line with what we discussed on the moves 12.Ng5 and 12...h6. We try to stop counterplay. Then we finish development. Then we find someplace for our king to chill while we prepare our attack with f5. }) 12... g6 { At first eyesight g6 looks very logical. It stops Qh5-f7# shenanigans and presumably helps black stop the f5 break. But those familiar with similar attacks, like you might find in the vastly different line that still shares some similarities Sicilian: Grand Prix Attack, know that f5 is coming no matter what. In addition g6 essentially begs white to push h4-h5, and it is unlikely black can respond with h6 or h5 to stop this because g6 is in itself a target, and can probably be exploited by some sort of battery on the b1-g6 diagonal.
Not that it probably matters in this position but there is also something to be said about overworking your black squared bishop. When both e6 and g6 are played the bishop wants to be both on the f8-a3 diagonal and on g7 to cover all the holes left behind. That is impossible and as a result black will be left with dark squared weaknesses that can possibly be exploited. It probably doesn't matter much here as black will either get mated or be fine. But it's a common theme in many different lines, so it's worth being aware of. } { [%clk 0:09:22] } (12... h6 { I'm adding this move to get around the word cap on a move and try to further enlighten you and bring you into my ever growing cult. The move is probably not very good as white can respond with Qh5 strenghtening the attack, so ignore it. Or don't. You can do what you want. We are a cool cult.
Some of the advantages of a more prophylactic playstyle:
1. Risk free: We aren't even going to consider obviously sketchy sacrifices. So we aren't gonna lose because we want to play pretty cool chess like the old masters. As a result our variance will decrease. I've personally learned this the hard way more times than I can count. At the same time we don't spend a lot of time on stupid fun moves. Risk free chess is good chess.
2. Fast:We can play simple fast chess. This factor is probably going to be increasingly important as time controls decreases as the attention span of humans grow shorter. We all know what happens when players get in time trouble. They panic, triggering our bloodlust, enraging us. Then we win, the end.
3. Efficient: It's a fairly low effort playstyle. As silly as it sounds energy conservation is important when it comes to long tournaments. If you overload your brain trying to calcualte everything and anything as fast as possible you are probably going to get tired. Tired chess is bad chess.
4. Feed on your oppoents frustration: We get to inflict maximum suffering on our opponent and feed on their energy. There is nothing more frustrating in chess than trying to make stuff happen without results. Your opponent will keep poking the bear without anything happening, not realizing we are really a turtle vibing in our shell. Patiently waiting. Until our opponent finally makes a mistake, and then... Surprise, we were a bear all along! It's too late. The boredom has already made our opponent to weak and slow to react to our overwhelming power. We quickly finish the job with a heavy piece to their head. This works against both higher and lower rated players. Typically lower and also younger players are more impatient and want to play juicy sacrifices. So we are not going to let them. Stronger players will be frustrated by your lack of frustration and eventually do something stupid. We don't discriminate based on rating. We will bore everyone to death equally, and having the times of our lives.
5. Just do it: Feel free to add your own reasoning. Our only limit is our imagination. Not really, but you get my point. Whether your goal is to have fun with chess or to improve I would greatly recommend exploring various ways of playing and finding structures to accompany those ways. Many find the best way to learn is by doing, and sometimes failing. Don't be one of the ones playing the London system for 80 years, never leaving the comfort of your d4-c3-e3 wall of shame. }) (12... Nb3 { Seems to be the most natural response and an attempt to punish white eagerness to launch an attack before finishing development. Please note that by simply following the basic principles of opening play we would avoid all this trouble. Our Knight on g1 would probably have been on f3 or e2 covering d4, or our bishop would be on e3 with the same result. So we could just probably just play Rb1. Then castle followed by something like f5. Black will still be in the same amount of trouble. The only thing that has changed is that white's position is safer. easier to play and less loose.
If this was bullet white could probably consider moves such as f5 here, just giving away the rook for some attacking chances. But any reasonable person will quickly conclude that there is realistic way it works. } 13. Rb1 (13. f5 Nxa1 14. fxe6 Bxe6 15. Nxe6 fxe6 16. Qh5+ g6 17. Bxg6+ hxg6 18.

If a closed centre allow for easier attacking chances. The opposite might also be true, and it typically is. A defender generally wants to break open the centre, or as in this case grab the central pawns for free. When the centre is open it is typically much easier to shuffle pieces back and forth to help defend both your king and weaknesses at the same time.
By losing the d4 pawn white's life has gotten much harder. There is no way black is going to believe we are a turtle now. It has broken our shell and seen our true form. White's entire centre has weakened f5 is harder to play as e5 is weaker and the knight on d4 directly covers the square.. The a7-g1 diagonal is now open making our king more exposed and castling harder as blacks black squared bishop is probably aiming for c5. } 14. Nxh7 { is the engine line. But, I mean... Sure we get a pawn back. But, we open the h-file allowing blacks rook to pressure us down the line. We also give black more time to finish development. This all seems highly suspect. } (14.

There isn't much black can do and white will soon cash in the full point. In general this might be the most sensible way of approaching chess. Simple, boring and safe moves that doesn't force you to even calculate correctly. BUT, and it's a big but, it is extremely boring.
